# twitch_bingo

This is a bullshit bingo generator for twitch or whatever you want. You have a pool of values, and they will be random picked and sorted.
You can change these values by changing it inside the html document: var bullshitBingo

Just open the html file in Firefox and make a window capture into Open Broadcaster. 
That's it. Happy clicking and failing :D
